                    <p>
                        In order to graduate from Penn State with an engineering degree, you must complete a senior design capstone project.  This project gets students involved with a sponsor to approach and solve a problem using the knowledge obtained through the undergraduate engineering program.  This project focuses on strong communication skills and quality teamwork in conjunction with engineering design solutions.

                <h3>
                Grader of Assingments for Artificial Organs Class
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Last spring, I took a biomedical engineering class on artificial organs and found it to be amazing!  While the lessons definitely covered topics such as 3D printed hearts and prosthetic legs, there was also a huge focus on the engineering design method.  I felt that this class did an excellent job of encompassing engineering to the human body with real-life applications.  For example, our final project for this class was to engineer a solution for one of the members of Team USA in the Paralympic Games.  I enjoyed it so much, that this spring I decided to come back to be a grader for the class so that I can get involved in the projects that the next group of students creates.

                <p>
                    I plan to be more than just a grader for this class.  I want to be able to support and encourage students to be creative and test ideas that might be out of the ordinary.  Some of the best creations come from thinking outside of the box!  I will create an open and approachable environment for the students to ask questions and receive feedback in a constructive and inspiring manner.

                <p>
                    One of the most important things I have learned throughout college is that making progress comes from helping out others and being a team player.  It is much harder to find answers if you do not ask the questions to begin with.  I saw this in action many times over this winter break when trying to troubleshoot code and figure out how to program the ideas that I wanted.  I know that I have been fortunate to learn so much through asking questions, whether it be in my classes, or solving HackerRank challenges.  I plan to use what I've learned to encourage others to do the same, as well as be supportive when others come to me asking questions and explain in a way that is helpful.
