                here i am going to type some fun facts or key points about me and who i am as a person and what my goals are for my career. --- list in notes on phone
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a senior studying at Penn State, and this January, I will be starting my final semester of biomedical engineering!  I feel that my degree has allowed me to see how versatile my career options are by allowing me to use ingenuity to develop creative solutions to problems.

                I think that fun facts are a great way to get to know a person, so below I have included a picture of when I went skydiving last year! ðŸª‚  It was one of the most thrilling and terrifying moments of my life, but an overall incredible experience that I am so glad I did.  Every year, I try to plan something super exciting and unique to look forward to so that I can experience the extraordinary wonders that this life has to offer.
