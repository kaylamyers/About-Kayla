                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a senior studying <abbr title="Biomedical Engineering">BME</abbr> at Penn State and I will be starting my final semester next week!  I feel that my degree has shown me how versatile my career options are by allowing me to use ingenuity to develop creative solutions to problems, both in and out of the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of my undergraduate education, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about how engineering principles are relevant to the human body.  Through my experiences at Penn State, I have found that I most enjoy the technological developments that are being implemented into the medical field.  Becuase of this, I am looking forward to moving along a career path that inspires growth and innovation, and I feel that Siemens is the perfect place to do that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been someone that works very hard to achieve the goals that I am striving for.  Throughout my classes, I have found that being persistent and taking the initiative to learn and grow is what makes for the most success.  I know that working in this position will be no exception for me and I will approach each day with a positive go-getter attitude!

                <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>          
                <p>
                    I think that fun facts are a great way to get to know a person, so below I have included a picture of when I went skydiving last year! ðŸª‚  It was one of the most thrilling and terrifying moments of my life, but an overall incredible experience that I am so glad I did.  Every year, I try to plan something super exciting and unique to look forward to so that I can experience the extraordinary wonders that this life has to offer.
