                    Front-End Innovation Product Developer Engineer Co-op
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        My second co-op experience with Kimberly-Clark (KC) was last summer (2023) in a product development role doing front-end innovation for the brand Goodnites&reg;.  As I was doing some absorbency product testing, I noticed that Goodnites&reg; was able to not only hold a lot more fluid but also absorb it at a faster rate than the leading competitor brand.  I communicated with the members on my team where we decided this was a great marketing opportunity.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here, I worked to develop side-by-side repeatability testing for both brands of product so that fair and honest marketing claims could be made.  To do this, I started by finding the shortest amount of time that allowed Goodnites&reg; to fully absorb the fluid.  I noted down every detail in my testing to then create standardized repeatability methods to demonstrate consistent results, proving our product was more successful every single time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step was to use this data to make consumer-relevant marketing claims for advertising purposes.  The goal here was to create a visual demonstration that seamlessly highlighted how our product was able to absorb a larger amount of fluid and at a faster rate than the competitor brand.  (Below you will see the advertisement that has been re-edited since last year for legal purposes.)

                    <p>
                        The claims from this visual demonstration have been one of KCâ€™s best performing advertisements, and has increased new consumer entry rate sales of Goodnites&reg; product.

                    Raw Materials Quality Process Engineer Co-op
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        After my sophomore year of college (2022), I decided to pursue a 6-month co-op position with Kimberly-Clark (KC) Corporation.  This was my first job opportunity in the corporate world and I was excited to get started and make an impact for the company.  I was assigned to work on the raw materials quality process engineering team in the commercial manufacturing plant in Neenah, Wisconsin where KC makes their Depend&reg;, Poise&reg;, and U by Kotex&reg; brands.  One of my main tasks and responsibilities for this job was to manage raw material complaint forms for non-conforming material on the production lines.  Since the facility operated 24/7, there was always material that needed to be evaluated and dispositioned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I noticed early on in my time there that all of the material complaint forms were completed and turned in on paper.  Because everything was accounted for on physical paper, I noticed many inconsistencies with material numbers and disorganized material.  I approached my mentor and manager about this issue and proposed the idea of implementing a digital complaint form system using scanner devices that the machine operators already used daily and felt comfortable with.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From here, I worked cross-functionally with IT and machine operators.  The first step was to make sure the necessary software was company approved by IT.  From here, I was able to develop a training plan for the machine operators and demonstrate to them how this new system will save them time and frustration when there is non-conforming material.  Additionally, I developed a training plan for the back-end of the online system to teach to the rest of the quality team so that everyone knew how to process the online complaints once my term was completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, this project was a huge learning opportunity for me and ended up saving time for the machine operators when filing complaints, as well as saving time for the quality team when tracking rejected material.  The new online complaint form system took <b>70% less time to complete</b> than the paper form on average, and eliminated incorrect data for quality reports.  This allowed for the made-up time to be focused on production of product.

                Grader/Teaching Assistant for Artificial Organs Class
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Last spring, I took a biomedical engineering class on artificial organs and found it fascinating!  While the lessons definitely covered topics such as 3D printed hearts and prosthetic legs, there was also a huge focus on the engineering design method.  I felt that this class did an excellent job of encompassing engineering to the human body with real-life applications.  For example, our final project for this class was to engineer a solution for one of the members of Team USA in the Paralympic Games.  I enjoyed it so much, that I decided to come back to help out the professor of the class so that I can get involved in the projects that the next group of students creates.  In this role, I decided to take on a different approach to one of the challenges and pursue a solution through computer science.  This led me to starting my <b><a href="journey.html#PersonalProject">Personal Project</a></b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal was to be more than just a grader for this class.  I wanted to support and encourage students to be creative and test ideas that might be out of the ordinary.  Some of the best creations come from thinking outside of the box!  I helped create an open and approachable environment for the students to ask questions and receive feedback in a constructive and inspiring manner.

                <p>
                    One of the most important things I have learned throughout college is that making progress stems a lot from helping out others and being a team player.  It is much harder to find answers if you do not ask the questions to begin with.  I know that I have been fortunate to learn so much through asking questions, whether it be in my classes, or solving programming challenges.  Moving forward in my engineering career, I plan to use what I've learned in my experiences to encourage others to do the same, as well as be supportive when others come to me asking questions and explain in a way that is helpful.
