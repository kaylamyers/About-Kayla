            <h2>Here are the steps I took to improve my software skills.</h2>
            <p>The only coding experience taught within the Penn State cuirriculum for <abbr title="Biomedical Engineering">BME</abbr> majors was Matlab/Simulink.  However, I was itching to go beyond the capabilities of Matlab and see what other problems I could solve through other languages.  Below is the combination of what I taught myself through trial and error, along with utilizing resources available to me online.</p>

                Starting out with Python

                <p>
                    Coming out of college without having a CS degree, I knew that my software skills might not be as developed as they needed to be for a software engineering job, even with an engineering background.  I decided to do my best to develop these skills to not only serve me well in my career, but to also work on personal projects to help change the world in my own creative way.  I had heard good things about using edX to learn new programming languages, so I figured that might be a good place to start.

                <p>
                    I chose to start with the edX class <i><b>CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python</b></i> which is run by <b>HarvardX CS50P</b>.  I found it very helpful that the platform had problem solving exercises that went along with each topic section.  I am definitely more of a hands-on learner, so I found this feature to help me understand more about <strong><em>why</em></strong> I was using the respective syntax that was shown in the lessons.

                <p>
                    I am currently about 30% finished with the lessons and programming challenges provided in this course and can easily say it has so far been the best resource I have used when learning Python!  I am excited to continue moving forward and learn as much as I can through the rest of this course and as I pursue others as this one concludes.

                <p>
                    When deciding to build this website through HTML, I utilized many online resources such as YouTube videos and W3Schools.  I found W3Schools to be very helpful when showing how to implement different features within my webpage.  It has additionally been very helpful when learning different Python strings and lists.  I am excited to do more online research to see how I can make my website even more exciting, and eventually implement CSS into the code!

                <h3>Personal Project</h3>
                <h4>Braille Translator Musical System</h4>
                <p>
                    If you have have not yet read about my experience as a TA/grader for an Artificial Organs class, you can do so <b><a href="career.html#Grader">here</a></b> for slightly more background on the inspiration for this personal project!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you have seen, the project for this class was based on Team USA Paralympic athletes.  So, since I was now seeing the course from a leadership perspective, it inspired me to get into approaching a problem for these athletes from a software engineering perspective.  Plus, since I was no longer enrolled in the course as a student and this time around I was the grader, I enjoyed tackling a problem from a different angle than before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The athlete that inspired me for this project was American sprinter, David Brown.  Brown is known as "the fastest completely blind athlete in history," having five world championship medals and one Olympic gold medal.  He was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease at 15 months old, which caused glaucoma and led to the loss of his sight.  As a child, Brown was inspired by his grandmother to play the piano, where he read Braille music for a period of time.  However, he did not like that approach and preferred to teach himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where my personal project comes into play.  I have been working on developing a Python script to translate standard text and musical notes into Braille.  To do this, I have utilized dictionaries to map characters to their Braille equivalents for improved accessibility.  As I continue to develop this program further, my goal is to eventually add haptic sounds for smartwatch communications that can be used outside of musical interpretation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program could have also been useful in the past for the development of famous blind musicians such as Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, and Andrea Bocelli.  It can also be used to help other blind people learn how to read and understand music.
